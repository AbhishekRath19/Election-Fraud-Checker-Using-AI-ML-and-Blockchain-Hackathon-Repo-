üìå Problem Statement

Election security has become a global concern, with ongoing debates about fraud, transparency, and public trust. Traditional voting systems (paper-based or electronic) are vulnerable to tampering, lack transparency, and often exclude real-time monitoring capabilities.

We propose a secure, AI-enhanced voting platform that leverages Blockchain for encryption, tamper-resistance, and auditability, alongside AI/ML for anomaly detection, voter verification, and real-time analytics.

This system is designed as a hackathon-scale proof-of-concept to demonstrate how combining AI and Blockchain can address election fraud, improve transparency, and enhance voter confidence.

üéØ Objectives

Ensure tamper-proof vote storage via blockchain smart contracts.

Guarantee voter privacy and anonymity while maintaining transparency.

Use AI/ML to:

Detect suspicious patterns (e.g., multiple votes from one identity/IP).

Enable voter verification through face recognition or ID checks.

Provide real-time analytics for monitoring turnout and detecting anomalies.

Deliver a scalable, user-friendly prototype that demonstrates innovation in election technology.

‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture
üîπ Blockchain Layer

Smart contracts to securely store encrypted votes.

Immutable audit logs for transparency.

Use of testnets (Polygon, Ethereum, or Hyperledger) for demonstration.

Potential integration of zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) for voter anonymity.

üîπ AI/ML Layer

Voter verification: Deep learning‚Äìbased facial recognition.

Anomaly detection: ML models to flag abnormal voting patterns (e.g., clustering, isolation forest).

Analytics dashboard: Visualize turnout, fraud alerts, and trends in real time.

üîπ Application Layer

Frontend: React Native or React for casting votes.

Wallet Integration: MetaMask/Web3 wallet for blockchain interaction.

Admin Dashboard: Visual fraud detection + real-time statistics

üöß Challenges & Considerations

Scalability: Handling millions of votes may lead to blockchain congestion and high gas fees.

Solution: Use Layer-2 scaling (Polygon, zkRollups).

Privacy & Security: Preventing vote tracing, vote selling, and coercion.

Solution: Cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption and ZKPs.

Key Management: Voters losing private keys could compromise the process.

Solution: Introduce social recovery mechanisms or biometric fallback.

Infrastructure: Blockchain e-voting is still experimental.
